# ASMI

This is the algorithm ASMI. The paper has been submitted to NeurIPS 2025. You can run the algorithm in runGridSearch.m to obtain results very close to those reported in the paper. In the code, you can define the dataset name, missing rate, and number of experimental trials as needed. All parameters have been automatically configured in this function and require no manual adjustment. If needed, additional experimental code will also be uploaded here.
